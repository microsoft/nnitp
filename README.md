# nnitp

Nnitp is a tool for interpretability of neural network inferences
using Bayesian interpolants. The basic technique is described in
[this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04198). It currently supports
convolutional neural networks for image classification, using the
[Keras](https://keras.io/) framework.
